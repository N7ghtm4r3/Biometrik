/**
 * @file WindowsHelloEngine.h
 * @brief Header file for the authentication engine using Windows Hello.
 *
 * This file defines the detectable authentication statuses and provides
 * the interface for requesting user authentication through Windows Hello.
 *
 * It also manages the dynamic link library (DLL) import/export mechanism:
 * - When the `WINDOWSHELLO_EXPORTS` macro is defined (typically during DLL compilation),
 *   the symbols are exported using `__declspec(dllexport)`
 * - When the macro is not defined (e.g., when using the DLL in another project),
 *   the symbols are imported using `__declspec(dllimport)`
 *
 * This ensures that the same header can be used for both building the DLL and linking against it.
